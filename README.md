## Step 1
Breathe and stay calm

## Step 2
Install Arduino (if you didn't already do that), just choose the latest version...
https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

## Step 3
When you have your Arduino software installed, click Sketch>Include Library>Manage Libraries>And search for EnableInterrupt

## Step 4
Download (or copy paste) the code from this github into your arduino software.

## Step 5
Choose how many channels you'll need. (a normal bot usually takes 3-4 channels). The remotes support up to 6 channels, but you'll need to solder potentiometers/switches to make them functional.

(To start (and make things move), lets just use 2 channels, you can just copy paste te code from the github). When you have this working and tested you can move to step 7

## Step 6

Connect the hardware
